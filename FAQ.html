        <h2>What is the test being used for the exam?</h2>
        <p>The objective of the test is to assess the severity of symptoms of anxiety. Each question of the test
            is defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both psychic anxiety and somatic anxiety. 
            There are a lot of automatic anxiety tests on the internet, some are also adapted from established 
            research psychology institutions just like HAM-A, this can endanger the researchers thesis because 
            the thesis must be unique.
        </p>
        <p>
            The test is a 14 Item test that have a scoring method on a 5-point likert scale ranging from 0 to 4.
            Each question asks for present anxiety symptoms, the likert scale will be helpful to determine
            the severity of those symptoms based on the narratives of the patient.
        </p>

        <p>
            After releasing the results, there should be notable points. For example:
            The individual answered “Very Severe” in number 9 which is about Cardiovascular
            symptoms such as Tachycardia, palpitations, pain in chest, throbbing of vessels, fainting
            feelings, missing beat. The reason for highlighting this is to help the patient and psychiatrist
            identify the complications the patient is feeling. It is easier this way to detect high risk
            and very severe symptoms.

        <h2>What is the difference between anxiety and depression?</h2>
        <h5>Anxiety Vs. Depression</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Anxiety and depression are both mood disorders, each with its own set of symptoms and characteristics. While depression 
                typically manifests as feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and reduced energy, anxiety is characterized by nervousness, 
                worry, or dread. It's important to note that individuals can experience both anxiety and depression simultaneously, and 
                distinguishing between the two can be complex due to overlapping symptoms.
            </li>
            <li>
                Depression affects mood and behavior, often resulting in persistent sadness, loss of interest in previously enjoyable 
                activities, changes in appetite and sleep patterns, and difficulty concentrating. To be diagnosed as depression, these 
                symptoms must persist for at least two weeks and not be attributable to any underlying medical conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Anxiety, on the other hand, involves excessive worry and fear that may not subside and can interfere with daily life. 
                Symptoms of anxiety include feeling overwhelmed, irritable, shaky, or out of control. There are various types of anxiety disorders, 
                such as generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), 
                and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), each with its own specific symptoms and triggers.
            </li>
            <li>
                While depression and anxiety have distinct symptoms, they often coexist, with about 60% of individuals experiencing symptoms of 
                both conditions. Genetic factors, brain chemistry, and early life experiences contribute to the development of these disorders.
            </li>
            <li>
                Diagnosing and treating anxiety and depression requires a comprehensive approach involving therapy, medication, lifestyle changes, 
                and social support. Talk therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy, can help individuals manage 
                symptoms and develop coping strategies. Medications like antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and 
                serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), are commonly prescribed to alleviate symptoms of both anxiety and depression.
            </li>
            <li>
                In addition to professional treatment, lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise, relaxation techniques (e.g., yoga, meditation), 
                dietary adjustments, and seeking social support from friends and family can also contribute to managing symptoms and improving overall well-being.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of anxiety or depression, seeking help from a healthcare professional is crucial. 
                Recognizing the symptoms and understanding the differences between anxiety and depression can facilitate appropriate diagnosis and 
                effective treatment strategies.

        <h2>What to do If ever a person receives a Mild Severity Result, Mild to Moderate Severity Result, or Moderate to Severe Result</h2>
        <h2>Mild Severity</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                If someone is dealing with mild anxiety and depression, it's essential to recognize the signs and know when to seek help. Mild depression often 
                manifests as a low mood and other symptoms, but they're not as severe as with major depression. Common signs include irritability, fatigue, feeling 
                hopeless or worthless, difficulty focusing, changes in sleep and appetite, and thoughts of death or suicide.
            </li>
            <li>
                These symptoms may persist for two weeks or more, indicating a need for intervention. Seeking help early can prevent more serious complications. 
                Mild depression can affect social and work life, even if others don't notice the symptoms. It's crucial to address new or worsening symptoms promptly.
            </li>
            <li>
                There are various types of depression, ranging from persistent depressive disorder to seasonal affective disorder and postpartum depression. Treatment 
                options typically involve a combination of therapy and medication. Therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, can help individuals understand and 
                manage their thoughts and behaviors. Medication, like antidepressants, may also be prescribed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lifestyle changes play a significant role in managing mild depression. These changes may include adjustments to diet, exercise, recreational activities, 
                sleep habits, and social interactions. While some lifestyle changes have strong evidence supporting their effectiveness, others may require more research.
            </li>
            <li>
                It's essential to seek help from a qualified healthcare professional if experiencing symptoms of depression. Doctors can diagnose depression and recommend 
                appropriate treatment options. Medicare and most insurances cover treatment for depression, including therapy and medication, when provided by licensed 
                professionals. Remember, early intervention and seeking support are key to managing mild anxiety and depression effectively. If thoughts of self-harm or 
                suicide arise, immediate assistance should be sought.

        <p><b>Crawford, J. Reviewed by Marney, A.(2023, December 7). What are the signs of mild depression?
        <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321385">https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321385</a></b></p>

        <h2>Mild to Moderate Severity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Moderate depression, though less severe than severe depression, still affects one's ability to function normally. Symptoms include persistent low mood, 
                decreased interest in activities, changes in appetite and sleep, fatigue, excessive worry, and feelings of hopelessness or guilt. Women are nearly twice 
                as likely to experience depression as men, and moderate depression can impair work, school, and social life.
            </li>
            <li>
                Diagnosis involves a physical exam, medical history review, and symptom assessment. Clinicians use diagnostic criteria outlined in the DSM-5, with clinical 
                depression requiring at least five of nine symptoms during a two-week period, including depressed mood, loss of interest, sleep disturbances, fatigue, 
                changes in weight, feelings of worthlessness, difficulty concentrating, and suicidal thoughts.
            </li>
            <li>
                Treatment for moderate depression often includes psychotherapy, medication, or a combination of both. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) helps identify and 
                replace negative thought patterns. Other therapeutic approaches like dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) can also be beneficial. 
                Antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are commonly prescribed medications.
            </li>
            <li>
                Complementary treatments like St. John's wort may help alleviate symptoms, but should be discussed with a doctor due to potential interactions. Lifestyle 
                modifications, such as regular exercise and stress management techniques like yoga and mindfulness, can also be effective. Practicing self-care, maintaining a 
                healthy diet, seeking social support, and engaging in enjoyable activities are vital, even though depression may make these tasks challenging. Reaching out to 
                loved ones can provide significant support during difficult times.

        <h2>Moderate to Severe</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Clinical depression, also known as major depressive disorder (MDD), is marked by persistent low mood and loss of interest in previously enjoyable 
                activities, lasting at least two weeks. It affects sleep, appetite, and cognitive function, often occurring in episodes lasting weeks or months. 
                Women, those without close relationships, and individuals facing major life changes are more susceptible.
            </li>
            <li>
                Symptoms range from sadness to psychomotor agitation and suicidal thoughts. Causes may include neurotransmitter imbalances, genetics, adverse 
                childhood experiences, and stressful life events. Diagnosis involves evaluating symptoms and ruling out other conditions, typically requiring five 
                or more specific symptoms.
            </li>
            <li>
                Treatment usually combines medication and psychotherapy, with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for severe cases. Antidepressants may take weeks to 
                show full effects, while psychotherapy often requires multiple sessions for improvement. Prevention involves maintaining healthy habits and seeking help promptly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Despite its challenges, clinical depression is treatable, with 80% to 90% of patients responding well to treatment. However, untreated depression 
                can lead to complications such as anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and worsening physical health conditions. Seeking support from healthcare providers 
                and loved ones is crucial for managing clinical depression effectively.

        <h2>What are the benefits of group therapy?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Group therapy is a form of psychotherapy where one or more mental health practitioners provide therapy to multiple individuals in each session.
            </li>
            <li>
                Group therapy is beneficial for anyone, especially those with limited access to mental healthcare, 
                as it brings together people who share similar experiences and focuses on specific mental health concerns.
            </li>
            <li>
                Group therapy operates based on 11 primary factors outlined by Irvin D. Yalom, including instillation of hope, 
                universality, imparting information, altruism, and more.
            </li>
            <li>
                There are several types of group therapy, including psychoeducational groups, skills development groups, cognitive-behavioral groups, 
                support groups, and interpersonal process groups.
            </li>
            <li>
